# Overview

## Objective
ML Study Jam is a learning opportunity orgainzed by [Malaysia TensorFlow & Deep Learning User Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TensorFlowMY) together with Sunway University Tech Club & Sunway DataXSight Research Cluster, which takes 4 weeks of time leveraging on [Kaggle Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn). It includes hands-on assignments, tutoring, tech talks and group discussions. This is a great opportunity to bring members of your community together to learn something online.  

[Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) is the world’s largest data science and machine learning community. It offers a no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment, access to free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data & code.  

## ML Study Jam Mode
This is a study program going through Kaggle courses sequentially. The goal of these assignments is to rapidly cover the most essential skills. Such as how to use TensorFlow or Pandas and how to build your first machine learning model. This online-oriented program suggests that the participants study by themselves. Studying with others is a more effective way to master courses sometimes, therefore, we’re suggested to study together online.  

There will be short lectures/talks by industry practitioners (virtual & physical) event planned at the end of the week.  

## Digital Certificate & Badge
