# Overview
## Objective
ML Study Jam is a learning opportunity orgainzed by [Malaysia TensorFlow & Deep Learning User Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TensorFlowMY), which takes 4 weeks of time leveraging on [Kaggle Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn). It includes hands-on assignments, tutoring, tech talks and group discussions. This is a great opportunity to bring members of your community together to learn something online.  

[Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) is the world’s largest data science and machine learning community. It offers a no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment, access to free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data & code.  

## Target audience
Aspired Data scientists/Data Analysts. Also software engineers and data engineers interested in learning Python programming, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge (1+ years of professional experience)
- Basic Mathematics & Statistics knowledge
- Being comfortable with command line

## Timeline
TBA
